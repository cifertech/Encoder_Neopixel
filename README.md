# Encoder_Neopixel

The Neopixel LED module has many attractive features. With a microcontroller base, they can produce millions of different lights. In this tutorial, we are going to change the status of the neopixel LED according to the required colors with the help of the rotary encoder module and Arduino board. In this way, by changing the rotary angle of the encoder in each step, the status of the neopixel LED will also change.
